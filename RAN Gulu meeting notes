 We need to get context specific issues and address those in the areas. theres are issues that are sp-ecific to individual contexts..  the next meeting should be one that looks into the communities and identifies the ones that we are going to work with. 
 
 We are going into the communities and make sure that the topic chosen is applicable to all the areas that are being looked into.
 
 THe community visits build onto the work that we did yesterday and then the community work is guided.
 
 Generally there are six areas. we can then take some from those basing on the survey that we will do. 
 
 Be mindful to not force issues on communities because one community is an outlier.
 
 
 First case for M&E : communuitly level indicators of the station being adopted.
 
 Second case : what is the impact that is being felt in these communities
 
 Important for first phase: can the stations be adopted? then what are the impact issues that we can measure.
 
 Provide a work plan to show the project course over the six months. 
 
 Get some video from the communities that we are working in.
